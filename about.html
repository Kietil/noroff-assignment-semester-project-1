          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>Wildwoven Hikes began with a simple idea: that hiking could be more than distance and elevation — it could
            be connection. We believe in travel that respects nature, uplifts culture, and brings people together.</p>

            Solo hiking doesn't mean hiking alone. Join our community of independent explorers who value both solitude
            and connection. Our solo-friendly hikes offer the perfect balance of personal reflection time and meaningful
            encounters with fellow travelers.

            Whether you're seeking a meditative mountain sunrise, challenging yourself on a multi-day trek, or simply
            wanting to disconnect from daily life, our solo hiker programs provide safe, structured adventures with
            optional social elements. You choose your level of interaction.
